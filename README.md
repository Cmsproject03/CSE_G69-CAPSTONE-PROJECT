AgroDoc 🌿
A simple ML and DL-based website that recommends the best crop to grow, fertilizers to use, and the diseases caught by your crops.

DISCLAIMER ⚠️
This is a POC (Proof of Concept) kind-of project. The data used here comes with no guarantee from the creator. So, don't use it for making farming decisions. If you do so, the creator is not responsible for anything. However, this project presents the idea of how ML/DL can be used in precision farming if developed at a large scale and with authentic and verified data.

MOTIVATION 💪
Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a country’s economic growth.

In a country like India, the majority of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. Many new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are being implemented in agriculture to make it easier for farmers to grow and maximize their yield.

In this project, I present a website with the following applications: Crop recommendation, Fertilizer recommendation, and Plant disease prediction.

In the crop recommendation application, the user can provide the soil data, and the application will predict which crop should be grown.

For the fertilizer recommendation application, the user can input soil data and the type of crop being grown. The application will predict what the soil lacks or has in excess and recommend improvements.

For the plant disease prediction application, the user can upload an image of a diseased plant leaf. The application will predict the disease, provide background information, and suggest ways to cure it.

DATA SOURCE 📊
Crop recommendation dataset (custom built dataset)
Fertilizer suggestion dataset (custom built dataset)
Disease detection dataset
